This project presents an in-depth financial analysis of LVMH and Ferragamo, focusing on their performance, risk profiles, and strategic financial decisions. The analysis begins with an overview of each company, including their leadership, industry context, and recent developments affecting their operations. Historical stock and bond prices were analyzed using various valuation methods to assess the fairness of current stock prices. For companies without bonds, bond prices were estimated based on firm ratings or loan data from balance sheets, calculating implied interest rates from interest payments. Using the last five years of financial data, key growth metrics and discount factor models were applied to compare calculated valuations with current stock prices.

The analysis also evaluates the risk-return profile of a portfolio formed with LVMH and Ferragamo stocks, comparing it to the performance of each stock individually. Additionally, the capital structure and cost of capital for both firms were assessed to understand their financial strategies. Finally, the dividend policies of the companies were analyzed to determine whether they align more with growth or value investment characteristics. This comprehensive study highlights key financial insights for both firms, offering a detailed perspective on their market positioning and financial management.
